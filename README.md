This repository was created as part of my homework for an online front-end development course called "SheCodes".

During the 'Plus' section of the course, I have been tasked with creating a weather app using BootStrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API (including use of axios/AJAX).

One assignment asks for me to upload a copy of my progress so far to GitHub.

The assignment recommends using a GitHub desktop application, but instead I have decided to use the terminal and commands.

Thank you for viewing!
